# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project is a webpage that contains all of my notes taken during the prework of a coding bootcamp. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.
I wanted to build this project in order to have all of my notes in one place.
In making this project, I learned how to use HTML to make a webpage, how to use CSS to design a webpage, how to use Git to add content into my webpage, and how to use Javascript to add logic into Chrome Devtools.

## Installation

n/a

## Usage

To use this webpage, read and review the notes taken in each section. You can view a prompt on what to study first by rightclicking the screen and clicking 'inspect elements', pressing Command+Option+I for MacOS, or pressing Control+Shift+I for Windows. This will give a list of the different notes in this project and a randomly assigned prompt for where to begin studying.

## Credits
